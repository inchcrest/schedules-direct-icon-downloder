# Schedules Direct Icon Downloader

A .NET console application for downloading channel icons from your schedules direct account.

## About

Use this program in conjunction with your [schedules direct](http://www.schedulesdirect.org/) account to download all channel icons added to your lineup.

This program was intended to download icons and rename them to fit the schema as defined by nPVR with schedules direct as the backedn and Kodi as the frontend.

## Help

You may run the program with the following command line options

-f, --folder      (Default: ChannelIcons) The name of the download folder you
                would like to create

-l, --logging     Turns logging on and off. Will write logfile to path

-p, --path        The folder path to download icons to

-u, --username    Your SchedulesDirect username

--help            Display this help screen.

## Disclaimer

This is not a fully featured program. It was programmed to rename icons to the expected format when working to nPVR and Kodi. It may not work with any other PVR backends. If you encounter errors, or would like a feature, please open an issue. I'd be more than happy to extend the program.
